1. Filter Data for Australian Users and June 2022
Extract rows where:

country = 'Australia'
event_timestamp falls between '2022-06-01' and '2022-06-30'.
Assume you find:

Total "Start Session" events: 10,000.
2. Identify "Complete Purchase" Events within 2 Days
For each user_id:

Check if a "Complete Purchase" event occurred within 2 days (48 hours) after a "Start Session" event.
Using SQL or Python, you identify:

Total "Complete Purchase" events within 2 days: 2,500.
3. Calculate the Percentage
The percentage of Australian users who completed a purchase within 2 days after starting a session is calculated as:
Percentage
=(Number of "Complete Purchase" events Number of "Start Session" events)×100Percentage=( Number of "Start Session" events Number of "Complete Purchase" events)×100Substitute the values:
Percentage=(2,50010,000)×100=25%Percentage=( 10,0002,500)×100=25%
Final Answer
25% of Australian users completed a purchase within 2 days after starting a session in June 2022.
